## Data from the maternity ward in a certain hospital shows that there is a historical average of 4.5 babies born in this hospital every day. What is the probability that more than 6 babies will be born in this hospital tomorrow?
  1. Step 1 is to set our variables we will need for the Cumulative Probability        Poisson formula.
  2. Step 2 is to prepare the formula. We will be setting the lower.tail to FALSE       So we can do greater than 6.

```{r}
successes <- 6
l <- 4.5

probability_of_greater_than_6_babies <- ppois(q = successes,
                                              lambda = l,
                                              lower.tail = FALSE)
probability_of_greater_than_6_babies

```
